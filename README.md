Hi, I'm Marcelo Landim

I've been working with web development, both front and back end, for the past 7 years or so.

Besides using javascript (vanilla, node, vue, react ...) and python (on the back end with Flask framework) in day-to-day projects, I'm learning Flutter/Dart 
and working really hard to understend and practice clean architecture concepts.
