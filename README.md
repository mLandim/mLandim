Hi, I'm Marcelo Landim

I've been working with software development, both front and back end, for the past 10+ years.

Most of my day-to-day projects involve using Typescript or Javascript (Vanilla, Vue, Angular...) and Python (with Flask framework on the back end). I'm also currently learning Rust 
and working hard to understand and practice clean architecture concepts.
